    <h1>Client UI development</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Client UI development for Java web applications involves 
        creating the user interface components that users interact 
        with in a web browser. This typically includes using 
        technologies like <b>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</b> to design 
        responsive and interactive front-end interfaces. Java web 
        frameworks such as Spring MVC, JavaServer Faces (JSF), and 
        Vaadin are often used to integrate back-end functionality
         with the front-end. The development process includes 
         designing layouts, implementing client-side logic, and 
         ensuring seamless communication with server-side components
          through RESTful APIs or other data exchange methods. 
          Effective client UI development aims to provide a 
          user-friendly, efficient, and visually appealing experience 
          for web application users.
